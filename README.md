"Roam away from home. Safely." Society of Women Engineers (SWE 2014) Hackathon sponsored by Google! We're building an Android app that helps you travel safely abroad. It provides you with real-time valuable information, such as safe and unsafe zones, emergency guidelines and valuable location-specific information about the places you are travelling to. Location-specific information is collected by crowdsourcing from user-input sources and from reliable data sources over the web.

Won the Engineer's Choice Best App at SWE + Google 2014 Hackathon.
